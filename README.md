Strength of materials automated testing system
http://ivzaitsev.pythonanywhere.com/

Currently has 4 types of tasks: bending of hyperstatic beams, stretching of isostatic rods, twisting of isostatic rods, calculating moments of inertia for various figures.

The system has a built-in generator for tasks which also serves as a solver.

User(i.e student) requests a new task and tries to solve it by submitting the answer. When generated, the system also solves the task and stores all its parameters in a database. Upon submitting his answer, the student immediately gets his result: right\wrong, and his attempt at solving is stored in a database. Any user can get his own stats of solving attempts and appointed tasks.

A user with admin privileges(i.e teacher) has access to the same things, plus 2 additional pages: another stats page, where any user can be selected and stats for this user will be displayed; and a page where he can select any task and it will be displayed with an answer.
